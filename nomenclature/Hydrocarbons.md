# 1. Hydrocarbons

Carbohydrates are the most basic organic compounds, consisting only of carbon and hydrogen atoms. Additionally, carbon connects with other carbon atoms with single, double or triple bonds. In this entry hydrocarbons with cyclic structure won't be discussed. Hydrocarbon in Korean is "탄화수소", which combines words 탄소 (Carbon) and 수소 (Hydrogen), with 화(化), which may correspond to change. This 화 connector may be useful for assembling more complicated compounds in making of this nomenclature.

## 1.1 Alkanes
Alkanes are saturated hydrocarbons in which carbon-carbon bond are single. In Korean there names are derived by transliteration of English names (메테인, 에테인), which are composed of numerical term followed by the ending ‘ane’[^1], with an exception to the first 4 of homologous series.

This provides us with the need of introducing the numerical terms in Korean language. I suggest (H-X.1)[^2] to use the native Korean numbers and its short version for 1-4 (한, 두, 세, 네) as numerical terms.

Considering experience in Polish nomenclature and that the word for carbon is 탄소, I think it's suitable to set suffix for Alkanes: "탄" (H-1.1).
