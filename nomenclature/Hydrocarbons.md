# 1. Hydrocarbons

Hydrocarbons are the most basic organic compounds, consisting only of carbon and hydrogen atoms. Additionally, carbon connects with other carbon atoms with single, double or triple bonds. In this entry hydrocarbons with cyclic structure won't be discussed. Hydrocarbon in Korean is "탄화수소", which combines words 탄소 (Carbon) and 수소 (Hydrogen), with 화(化), which may correspond to change. This 화 connector may be useful for assembling more complicated compounds in making of this nomenclature.

## 1.1 Alkanes
Alkanes are saturated hydrocarbons in which carbon-carbon bond are single. In Korean there names are derived by transliteration of English names (메테인, 에테인), which are composed of numerical term followed by the ending ‘ane’[^1], with an exception to the first 4 of homologous series.

This provides us with the need of introducing the numerical terms in Korean language. I suggest (H-X.1)[^2] to use the native Korean numbers and its short version for 1-4 (한, 두, 세, 네) as numerical terms.

Considering experience in Polish nomenclature and that the word for carbon is 탄소, I think it's suitable to set suffix for Alkanes: "탄" (H-1.1).

> CH<sub>4</sub> – 한탄\
C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> – 두탄\
C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub> – 세탄\
C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub> – 네탄\
C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>12</sub> – 다섯탄\
C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>22</sub> – 열탄

The decision of making rules in that manner is arbitrary. The one of the possible solutions could be setting numerical terms similar to English ones without the vowel (e.g 1-메ㅌ, 5-펜ㅌ, 10-데ㅋ) and an/안 would be connected with the consonant. This way we could build names that are more blended into current nomenclature, as they would be generally transliteration of Polish naming. But one of advantages of using proposed numerical terms are direct relation with numbers used in Korean.

## 1.2 Alkenes and alkynes
Alkanes are hydrocarbons, which at least one of the carbon-carbon bonds is double. Alkaynes are hydrocarbons, which at least one of the carbon-carbon bonds is triple. 

IUPAC recommends alkanes or alkynes to be called only when only one double/triple bond exist in the structure and to classify other as alkadienes, alkatrynes etc[^3][^4]. For simplicity all structures containing double/triple bond between carbon atoms will be classified as alkanes/alkynes in this chapter. In IUPAC nomenclature suffix "ane" changes to "ene" in alkanes and "yne" in alkynes proceded by a multiplying term and a locant number[^5]. 

In this case it's suitable to keep suffix similar to English nomenclature for simplicity. Therefore suffix for alkenes and alkynes should be ~텐 and ~틴 (H-1.2.1). Locant number may not be written if it does not introduce ambiguity (e.g 두텐, 세틴)(H-1.2.2). There are hydrocarbons, which consists both of double and triple bonds. Those hydrocarbons should be named in order of ~텐 then ~틴 (H-1.2.3). Additonaly numbering of carbon atoms should be conducted according to rules of IUPAC nomeclature (H-X.3)

Considering that numerical terms are native Korean numbers, locant numbers can be pronounced as sino-korean numbers, but written in arabic numbers (H-X.2). Multiplying terms are used to indicate number of bonds or locants. To avoid ambiguity I think it is proper to remove multiplying terms. This topic requires discuision whether information conveyed by multipying terms is more valuable than repeating the number that may confuse. (e.g pent-1,5-diene - 다섯-1,5-두텐). In English nomenclature multiplying term may be confusing with numbers higher than 4 (e.g pent-1,2,3,4,5-pentene)

> CH<sub>2</sub>~C-CH=CH<sub>2</sub> – 네-1-텐-3-틴\
CH<sub>2</sub>=CH-CH=CH-CH=CH<sub>2</sub> – 여섯-1,5-텐
