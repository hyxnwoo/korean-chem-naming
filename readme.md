# ⚗️🇰🇷한화명[^1] - Korean Chemistry Nomenclature

This project is a personal research initiative focused on developing a Korean-based system for the nomenclature of organic compounds. Currently, the IUPAC names of organic compounds in Korean are typically derived through direct transliteration from their English equivalents. A notable exception is the use of “~산” for acids[^2]. The 한화명 system seeks to reduce transliteration by introducing Korean alternatives wherever possible. While not intended for formal use in scientific communication, where English nomenclature remains more practical, this project serves as an exploration of potential strategies for wordbuilding in Korean from the perspective of a non-native speaker of the language
